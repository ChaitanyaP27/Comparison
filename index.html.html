  			<h3>Verdict:-</h3>
  			<p>The OnePlus Nord 2 offers a thoughtful pick of flagship features at a mid-range price. There is a 90Hz Fluid AMOLED, the best MediaTek chipset right now - Dimensity 1200, a flagship-grade 50MP Sony camera with OIS, and impressively fast 65W Warp Charge coming lifted from the OnePlus 9 series.The Nord 2 not only handles very well under pressure, but it also offers loud stereo speakers, good photo and video quality, long-lasting battery life, one impressive connectivity suite and everything is wrapped within a mesmerizing body designed to impress. Of course, nothing will work this well if it weren't for the fan-favorite OxygenOS - one of the fastest launchers on the market to date.</p>
  			<p>Price=27,999.</p>
  			<h3>Conclusion:-</h3>
  			<p>The phone is amazing for daily usage and for its cameras,but costs a few thousand rupees more than Realme X7 Max 5G.You should definately go for this if you are willing to pay extra money.</p>
